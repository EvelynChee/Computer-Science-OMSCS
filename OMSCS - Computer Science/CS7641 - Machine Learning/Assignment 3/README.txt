This folder contains all files that were generated using Weka 3.7,
used in the analysis of the six algorithms as part of Assignment 3.

In order to recreate these results, please download weka 3.7 from 
the following link based on the OS available;

http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html

Once downloaded, the 2 datasets used in this analysis can be found 
in the "data" folder with the following names;

1) data\Car Evaluation Data

2) data\Glass Identification Data

Under each of these 2 folders there are results files under each of 
the 6 algorithms. These results files were generated by modifying 
the input parameters from the Weka 3.7 GUI. In order to recreate 
these results, please open the relevant results file and use the 
following line to populate the input list for Weka from the GUI;

Eg:weka.clusterers.EM -I 100 -N -1 -X 10 -max -1 -ll-cv 1.0E-6 -ll-iter 1.0E-6 -M 1.0E-6 -K 10 -num-slots 1 -S 100

The above line runs the EM algorithm. Once the inputs have been 
chosen the start button run the classifier and the results can be 
verified.

The data folder contains the results summaries from all the runs.

Results:

All the results from all the runs used for the analysis in this 
assignment has been included for each of the 6 algorithms in the results folder. 
This Results folder also an Excel Workbook used for genetaring plots and tables 
for the analysis. All the plots generated in the report can be found this 
Excel sheet. This Excel sheet has multiple tabs.

NOTE: 

1) For the Car Evaluation dataset, data transformations were carried 
out to convert nominal to numeric values. This transformed data can be 
found in;

data\Car Evaluation Data\preprocess_car_data.csv

this file should be used in Weka for data input.
