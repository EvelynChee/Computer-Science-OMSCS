# Project Plan

**Author**: Joel Henry

## 1 Introduction

We are building a mobile app on the Android platform that allows a manager of a smoothie cart to administer their customers, transactions and rewards.  This app is intended to be as intuitive, simple and as reliable as possible to ensure that the business is as successfull as possible.  This document outlines the process that we plan to use to implement app.

## 2 Process Description

We will be using an iterative and incremental approach to developing this app, known as Unified Process.  A waterfall-like software development process will be followed in the execution of this project and the activities involved are as follows:

`Inception -> Elaboration -> Construction -> Transition`

###Inception

We are building this app for a customer that needs it to run their smoothie cart business.  The requirements for the app are mostly defined for us.  These requirements are detailed enough for us to create use case diagrams, uml diagrams, and other supporting documents that will define the system architecture.

We estimate that the project will take 120 hours of combined effort to plan, develop, implement and test the application.

###Elaboration

Once the requirements are fully defined, the system architecture will be developed.  This activity may include the creating of class diagrams, case diagrams, sequence diagrams and lists of methods necessary to satisfy the list of functional requirements. The system design activity will be headed by the project manager and all the team members will provide inputs during this process. This activity will be completed when all the requirements are well represented and the software architecture is completely defined.

###Construction

Once the system design is completed, actual implementation work will commence which will include the majority of the functional coding.  All of the classes, objects and methods will be created in the form defined by the system design. The code will be broken down and developed by all the team members and a central Github repository will be used to track all changes. The development activities will be carried out in branches and once the final application is reviewed and approved by the development lead, it will be merged to the master branch. Code development process will strictly adhere to the requirements documents and any changes along the way will be reviewed by the team members and adjusted accordingly. This process will be iteratively carried out until all the requirements are satisfactorily met for the project and the source code will be made available upon completion.  This activity will be deemed complete when the software system is in a functional state and ready for testing.

###Transition

Once the implementation of the system is completed, the testing phase will begin. This activity will involve the setting up of a QA procedure by the QA manager. As part of this procedure several unit tests will be developed in conjunction with the code. Important validation tests will be carried out by the QA manager to test the functionality of the code and a set of example cases will be created for the user. The QA team, constituting of all the team members, along with the QA manager will develop these validations and unit tests. The application will be released only after all these tests have successfully passed. These tests will be provided as part of the project and will be well documented.  The full details of the Test Plan is contained in the separate Test Plan document.

## 3 Team

The team is made up of the following members:

- Joel Henry
- Gandharv Kashinath
- Jaspreet Bajwa
- Haresh Bhagchandani

The following table summarizes the roles of the various team members:

| Member  |Project Manager  | Development Lead  | Documentation Lead  | QA Manager  |Developer | Tester  | 
|--------:|----------------:|------------------:|--------------------:|------------:|---------:|--------:|
|Joel Henry |X  | | | |X  |X |
|Haresh Bhagchandani  | |X |  | |X |X  |
|Jaspreet Bajwa | | |X | |X  |X  |
|Gandharv Kashinath | |  |  |X |X |X  |

Note that all the team members will be responsible for the development work and testing. They will also contribute to the project with their ideas and assigned tasks by completing them in a timely manner.  The roles are described below.

###Joel Henry (Project Manager)

Will serve as the project manager and will track the progress of the various groups while making sure the project goals are met in a timely fashion. The project manager will also be responsible for the process planning and organizing teams to carry out required tasks.

###Haresh Bhagchandani (Development Lead)

Will serve as the development lead and will be in charge of all the development activities carried out during the project. The development lead will manage the version control system by creating branches for the individual developers to perform their tasks and merging them accordingly. Coding standards will be established and the code will be regularly reviewed to check if those standards are being met by the development lead.

###Jaspreet Bajwa (Documentation Manager)

Will serve as the documentation lead and will oversee the writing of the user manual. The user manual will be written predominantly by the documentation lead while getting inputs from various team members accordingly.

###Gandharv Kashinath (Testing Manager)

Will serve as the QA manager and will be in charge of developing relevant unit tests and validation cases for the application. These tests will be used during the development process to ensure the quality of the application and the QA manager will enforce the developers to perform these tests while doing the development work. Finally, the QA manager will verify if all the tests have passed while ensuring the requirements for the application have been met.
