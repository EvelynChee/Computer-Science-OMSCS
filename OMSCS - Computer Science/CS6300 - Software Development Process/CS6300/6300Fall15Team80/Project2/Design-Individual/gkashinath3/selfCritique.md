## Pros:

1) Using the aggregation relationships helps to break down the classes and find relationships between them. 
2) This aggregation helps break down the code and make it more manageable and optimize the UI modules.
3) Computed quatities were missing in other designs which will be incorporated in the new design.
4) Helped identify that the credit card class doesn't need storage and also is independent of other classes like rewards and discount in the class diagram.

## Cons:

1) The design was more flowchart like and was missing methods in the classes.
2) Although the class diagram captured the class relations, it was missing the UML format or methods within classes.
3) QR code and ID generations could have been utilities rather than classes.
4) Missing utilities like money and date.
