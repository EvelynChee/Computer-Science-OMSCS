## **Unit Conversion Android App**

This application does the following conversions between Unit 1 and Unit 2 (and vice-versa):

Measurement  |Unit - 1        |Unit - 2      |
------------ | -------------- |----------------
Distance     | Miles          | Kilometers    |
Area         | Square feet    | Square meters |
Currency     | US Dollar      | Euro          |
Fluid        | Liquid ounce   | Liter         |
Weight       | Pounds         | Kilograms     |

The application starts at the home screen which presents the user options to select their measurement units through buttons. Once a button is clicked, the measurement conversion page is opened which allows the user to input the numerical value of the units being converted. Only a numerical value is accepted in this text box. Under the text box is a radio button and clicking on the desired units implements the unit conversion. The Back button helps the user navigate back to the home screen.

This app was built to run on any platform with Android OS 21.
